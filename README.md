# pskMaya
Unreal PSK Importer for Autodesk Maya, supports skeletal- & static meshes

# Disclaimer

This was written over 2 years ago and I was still learning a lot about programming, Maya, etc. then, so this is not exactly that good of an importer, if you want to fork and improve, feel free too, but it's unlikely I'll rewrite it or improve it

# Installing
1. Download the source code
2. Add the Python scripts to your scripts folder (usually in Documents/maya/maya_ver/scripts).
3. Open your usersetup.mel (create one if you don't have one) and add the following:
`python("import pskMaya");`
4. Restart Maya or input above line into MEL to initiate script without restarting.
